## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover **revenue leakage**, **market share loss**, and **operational inefficiencies** for **Atliq Grand**, a five-star hotel chain.

Using **Power BI**, I developed a dynamic, end-to-end dashboard to help the leadership team make **data-informed decisions** that improve bookings, optimize revenue, and enhance guest experience.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

| Insight | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 💸 **Revenue Loss** | Out of $2.01B booked revenue, only $1.71B was realized. Loss of ~$300M (≈15%) due to cancellations & no-shows. |
| ❌ **High Cancellation Rate** | 24.8% of all bookings are canceled. 5% are no-shows. |
| 🌐 **Booking Platform Dependency** | 55K+ bookings come from “Others” (uncategorized platforms). Direct bookings (online/offline) are underperforming compared to OTAs. |
